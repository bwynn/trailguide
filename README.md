Mountain Bike Trail Guide is a web application that lets a user search for mountain bike trails using geolocation and Google Maps API. Users are able to get recommended trails based on criteria they set in their profile or via a detailed Query.

## Application Description
Mountain Bike Trail Guide - MBTG as it will be called from here on out, uses MongoDB for data storage/retrieval, Node.js and Express as the server and middleware, and uses Angular to round out the front end.
